# open-channels — agent instructions

One inbox over every channel you (the agent) sit on. **You own the channels the
app can't reach; the app owns storage, the human view, and any channel it can
send on itself.**

WhatsApp runs through the org's connected integration, so the app sends there
directly and a human's message goes out the moment they click Send. You are not
in that path — don't relay it, don't confirm it. Everything else still queues to
`/api/outbox` for you.

## Division of labour

- **Mirror, don't summarize.** Post the raw message body to `/api/ingest` and
  let the app store and render it. Never rewrite or condense a contact's words.
- **Only send what the outbox gives you.** Never send a channel message because
  you saw it in a thread — the only messages you send on this app's behalf are
  the items returned by `GET /api/outbox`. Never confirm `sent` without having
  actually sent. An outbound message already marked `sent` or `failed` has been
  handled by the app; leave it alone.
- **Respect channel permissions.** Sending always goes through your normal
  channel tools, so allowlists and approval rules still apply. If a send is
  blocked, report it as `failed` with the reason — don't work around it.
- **Don't manage templates.** The app pulls its own approved-template catalogue
  from the org's connected WhatsApp integration (`POST /api/templates/refresh`).
  You never sync, cache or curate it. If someone says the picker is empty, tell
  them to hit Refresh in the composer, or call that endpoint once yourself.
- **An outbox item with `template` is a template send.** Send it through the
  channel's *template* API with that exact name, language and variables. Never
  send its `body` as text: the body is the rendered preview for humans, and
  freeform is precisely what the 24-hour window forbids.

## Procedure 1 — mirror every channel message

Whenever a message arrives on (or is sent from) a channel you manage, and once
per conversation when backfilling history:

1. `POST /api/ingest` with:
   - `channel`: `whatsapp` | `telegram` | `slack` | `email` | `sms` | `other`
   - `contact`: `{ handle, name? }` — the channel-native address (phone, email,
     @username) and display name if known
   - `message`: `{ kind: "inbound" | "outbound", body, externalId?, at? }` —
     `externalId` is the channel's own message id (repeats are dropped, so
     re-ingesting is always safe); `at` is the original ISO timestamp for
     history backfill; use `kind: "outbound"` for messages you already sent
   - `subject`: email subject, when there is one
2. When you *act* on a conversation (book something, draft something, escalate,
   update a record), log one short line:
   `POST /api/conversations/:id/events` with `{ body: "Booked the Thursday 10:00 slot" }`.
   These render as the audit trail the human reviews — every meaningful action
   gets one.

## Procedure 2 — send queued replies

On a heartbeat, or when asked to "check the inbox":

1. `GET /api/outbox` — each item has `message.body`, `channel`,
   `contact.handle`, `subject` (email only), and `template` (or `null`).
2. Send it to that contact **through the channel's own tool**:
   - `template` is `null` → send `message.body` as a normal text message.
   - `template` is set → send it as a **template**, passing `template.name`,
     `template.language` and `template.variables` straight through (e.g.
     `WHATSAPP_SEND_TEMPLATE_MESSAGE`). Do **not** send `message.body`.
3. Confirm: `POST /api/messages/{message.id}/status` with
   `{ "status": "sent" }`, or `{ "status": "failed", "error": "<why>" }` if the
   send didn't happen. Unconfirmed items stay queued and will be handed to you
   again.

## The 24-hour window (why some threads are template-only)

WhatsApp only lets a business send freeform text within 24 hours of the
contact's **last inbound** message. Outside that — and to a contact who has
never written — only a Meta-approved template goes out. The app enforces this
itself, so you don't have to reason about it:

- Humans see the composer switch to a template picker; the thread shows a
  "Template only" badge.
- Your `POST /api/conversations/:id/reply` gets a `409` if you send `body` to a
  shut thread. That is not retryable — send `template` instead.
- The app keeps its own catalogue fresh from the connected integration, so
  "there are no templates" is an integration problem, not a sync you owe.

## People: this inbox is not the CRM

A contact row here is a **channel identity** — one address on one channel. The
same human on WhatsApp and email is two rows. The *person* lives in whichever
app the org uses as its system of record, and that app owns them: their name,
their history, whether they still want to hear from you.

So a contact can carry a **link** to that person — an app id and a record id,
nothing else. Never copy the record in. A name mirrored here is a second source
of truth that goes stale silently and quietly contradicts the CRM.

**Configure it once** with `PUT /api/profile-source`. Every path and field name
below is an *example* — read the target app's `GET /api/openapi.json` and use
what it actually serves. One org's people app calls them customers, another's
calls them members, and the two disagree about everything else too:

```json
{ "appId": "<the sibling app's uuid>", "label": "Customers",
  "search": { "path": "/api/customers", "query": "q", "collection": "items" },
  "get":    { "path": "/api/customers/{ref}", "collection": "customer" },
  "fields": { "ref": "id", "name": "full_name", "phone": "mobile", "email": "email" },
  "profileUrl": "https://<that app>.apps.clawnify.com/customers/{ref}" }
```

Three things people get wrong:

- **`collection` is per operation, not per app.** A list endpoint returning
  `{"items": [...]}` and a detail endpoint returning `{"customer": {...}}` is
  normal — set it separately on `search` and `get`, and omit it entirely when
  the response *is* the array or the record.
- **`query` is that app's search parameter**, whatever it's called — `q`,
  `search`, `filter`. Get it from the spec, not from habit.
- **`fields` maps meaning onto their names.** `fields.ref` must name the id you
  will link to; the rest are optional and only affect display.

It is verified against the live app before it saves, so a wrong path or a wrong
`fields.ref` comes back as a `422` naming the problem rather than a picker that
is mysteriously always empty.

**Then link contacts as you learn who they are.** On ingest, add
`contact.linked: { appId, ref }` when you already know the person — you looked
the number up to answer them anyway. Only when you *know*:

- A confident match on a full phone number or email address is a link.
- A name that merely looks similar is **not**. Two people share a surname; a
  household shares a phone. A wrong link is worse than no link, because it
  silently attributes one person's conversation to another.
- Omitting `linked` never clears an existing link — absence means "didn't look
  it up", not "no longer linked". To correct a bad link, send the right one.

Humans get the same thing from the other end: starting a conversation, they
search the people app and pick someone, which fills the address and sets the
link. `GET /api/contacts/:id/profile` resolves a linked contact live — use it
instead of remembering what a member's phone number was last week.

## Pages

- `/` — the inbox (sidebar → conversation list → thread). Screenshot-friendly.
- Append `?agent` when browsing it yourself for larger targets.

## API anchors

Discovery: `GET /llms.txt` / `GET /api/openapi.json`. The shapes you'll write
most: `POST /api/ingest` and `POST /api/messages/:id/status` (above). Also
there when needed: `GET /api/conversations` (paginated, `?search=`),
`GET /api/conversations/:id/messages`, `POST /api/conversations/:id/comment`
(internal note), `PATCH /api/conversations/:id` (`{"status":"closed"}`).

## Failures

- `401` — the request lost its org identity: call the app through your app API
  tool, never with raw fetch.
- `403` on ingest — only agent/API callers may ingest.
- `duplicate: true` from ingest is success, not an error (idempotency did its job).
- `409` on reply — the 24-hour window is shut. Not retryable: send a template
  instead. (Humans see this as the composer switching to template-only.)
- `422` on reply — the template is unknown, not `APPROVED`, or missing variable
  values. Hit `POST /api/templates/refresh` before assuming the name is wrong;
  Meta may have paused or renamed it.
- `422` on `PUT /api/profile-source` — the target app didn't answer as described.
  The message says which part: a 404 means the `appId` isn't an app in this org,
  and a missing `fields.ref` means you named a field the records don't have.
- `409` on `/api/contacts/:id/profile` — that contact isn't linked, or no
  profile source is configured. Not an error to retry.
- `424` on profile search or resolve — the people app itself was unreachable or
  errored. The inbox keeps working; only the lookup is down.
